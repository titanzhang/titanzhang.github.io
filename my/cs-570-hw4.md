This page is a introduction of homework 4 as well as the ***prototype***, try it out by clicking the search icon and tag links above.

### Introduction
This design targets a functionality improvement of my personal website. This website is basically hosting articles about tools, languages and other technologies I learned and want to share with others. I have Google Analytics monitoring the traffic of my website and found an interesting user behavior. By looking at the visit history of some users, I noticed that their path is something like “article1 -> homepage -> article2 -> homepage -> …”. It means they finished one article and tried to find more, so they went from articles to homepage back and forth.

### Analyse
**Scenarios**: There are two scenarios in this case. One is the user reads an article and wants to know more about the technology introduced by this article. The other one is the user wants to find other articles in this website.   
**Persona**: People interested in technology and willing to learn.   
**Use case**: The following diagram shows the user cases.

* *Clicking the search button* performs a search request with the text in search box as the keyword and brings up the search result layer.
